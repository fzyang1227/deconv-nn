Copy this template on github, and rename the repo to the name of your project.

Then go to the repo "Settings" and change "Webhook" settings, to "Add a webhook."

Set up the webhook exactly as you see in the image below, so that it sends
JSON push notifications to `https://expo.baulab.info/push`.  To work, it will
need to have the secret pictured.

<img src="webhook.png" style="max-width:100%">

Then whenever you push your website, it will show up on
https://expo.baulab.info/2024-Spring/[username].  Customize your
`index.html`.

Your final project report will be a static HTML website that
shares your insights.  As you develop your
methods, results, and narrative, add content as needed here.
